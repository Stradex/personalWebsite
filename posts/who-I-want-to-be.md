# What about "be yourself?"

We all know the phrase *"Just be yourself"*, and I concur that in some way. I am from Argentina and there is a song here, *"SÃ© vos"* from a band called *"Almafuerte"* that talks exactly about how important is to be yourself in this world,
and I tried to live by that thinking many years of my life. Yes, if you are yourself sometimes life will be miserable when others look you down, when you start to doubt about yourself, about if you are doing thing wrongs or if there is
something wrong with you that is not allowing you to insert yourself into what many people expect from us, or what they make us believe we have to expect from us.

I like *(and I hate)* the *"Just be yourself"* advice, but there is people that make us think *"I want to be like this person"*, and no matter how proud we are to be ourselves we have to admit that there is people that inspire us deeply,
that make our eyes to bright, that make us feel how beautiful is to be alive just to appreciate their works and/or ideas

So yes, I want to be myself, I want to be miserable and happy, I want to dream, fail, fail, fail and keep failing until I am able to do what I wish or until I am about to die so I can say to myself *"I was myself, why I did such a stupid thing?"*
But also I want the version of myself to be as close as some people that I admire as possible, or have a bit of the pieces of the people that make me want to be alive when things look like shit because what they did inspire to believe that even under the
worst circumstances things can be achieved, and beautiful things that reach our soul and mind.

Now, let me talk you about the people that remind me that life is good.

## John Carmack

Follow me here. Imagine the following things.

1. You are born in the 90s
2. You are used to play 2D games
3. Then you discover **Doom** and **Quake**
4. You realize that everything that you played before look so boring and silly now. *(Don't hate me 80s people, Mario bros was good and so was the Royal Game of Ur I am sure)*
5. You wonder how it is possible to make such wonders in a computer. How to make a 3D game to work in a screen that is actually a plane.

Can you imagine all of that?, Great! Because that was me during my childhood, teen ages and young adult years. I did learn programming just to be able to one day make a game engine so I can try to even emulate what John Carmack did with Doom Engine and Quake engine. Did I make that engine?, hell no but I've learned so many things and spent the best moments of my life trying to figure out how to make a 2D game engine and later on a 3D game engine. 

I spent one year trying to make a 2D game engine using C, I failed but I did learn the basics of C. 
Then I spent one year trying to make a 2D Game engine using C++, I failed again but managed to make far more progress to even have a map editor working, a silly internal language for the Game Logic that actually was a programming language in Spanish, so it was a beautiful experience to me.
Then, again, I tried to make a 2D game engine *(Actually it would be a Framework)* using Javascript, HTML and CSS... and then I've failed again but reached an even further state with a map editor working, and I was able to make some small games to test the engine and even finished a Shoot'em up DEMO game with it.
Then, a last time, I learned some Linear Algebra, Discrete Maths and followed a basic book about WebGL to try to make my first small game engine using JS and WebGL, and guess what?, I failed again!.

A failure after failure, beautiful failures because those were the happiest days of my life since I was trying to imitate one of my idols: **John Carmack**, creator of Doom Engine and Quake Engine.

What you
