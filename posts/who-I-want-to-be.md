# What about "be yourself?"

We all know the phrase *"Just be yourself"*, and I concur that in some way. I am from Argentina and there is a song here, *"SÃ© vos"* from a band called *"Almafuerte"* that talks exactly about how important is to be yourself in this world,
and I tried to live by that thinking many years of my life. Yes, if you are yourself sometimes life will be miserable when others look you down, when you start to doubt about yourself, about if you are doing thing wrongs or if there is
something wrong with you that is not allowing you to insert yourself into what many people expect from us, or what they make us believe we have to expect from us.

I like *(and I hate)* the *"Just be yourself"* advice, but there is people that make us think *"I want to be like this person"*, and no matter how proud we are to be ourselves, we have to admit that there is people that inspire us deeply,
that make our eyes to bright, that make us feel how beautiful is to be alive just to appreciate their works and/or ideas
